An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

Example:

The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
Your function should return the int 5.
If no number was deleted from the array and no difference with it, your function should return the int 0.

Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).

function findDeletedNumber(arr, mixArr) {
  // your code
  const sorted=mixArr.sort((a,b)=>a-b)
  return arr.filter(item=> mixArr.sort((a,b)=>a-b).indexOf(item)===-1?item:0)[0]||0

}

function findDeletedNumber(arr, mixArr) {
  // your code
 
  return arr.reduce((acc,val)=>acc+val,0)- mixArr.reduce((acc,val)=>acc+val,0)

}
